   <h1 id="titulo">Cinco fontes</h1>
    
   <h2 class="nomeFonte">Bree Serif</h2>
    <p id="primeiroParagrafo">This friendly upright italic is the serif cousin of TypeTogether's award winning family Bree. Designed by Veronika Burian and José Scaglione.</p>
   
    <h3 class="nomeFonte">Anton</h3>
    <p id="segundoParagrafo">Anton is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface. The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers.</p>

    <h4 class="nomeFonte">Lobster Two</h4>
    <p id="terceiroParagrafo">Lobster Two is the updated and improved family version of The Lobster Font, featuring a new lighter weight and the two new upright variants.</p>

    <h5 class="nomeFonte">Reenie Beanie</h5>
    <p id="quartoParagrafo">Reene Beanie is a fun font based on basic ball-point pen handwriting. It has a playful and loose look, which lends itself to casual and informal messages. With a little imagination, Reenie Beanie could be used to represent the scribbling of a mad scientist, or the recipes of a genius chef.</p>

    <h6 class="nomeFonte">Major Mono Display</h6>
    <p id="quintoParagrafo">Majör Mono Display is a monospaced geometric sans serif all-uppercase typeface which also has a complete set of constructivist display characters with a playful attitude. It has many OpenType features, but the basic stylistic sets, serious sans serif, and playful display designs, are encoded as lowercase and uppercase characters. This makes it a great choice for playful web typography, especially at large point-sizes.</p>
